New to the Breaking Good Project or GitHub? 

You've come to the right place! 

This repository is your how to guide for using GitHub. 

The Breaking Good Project uses GitHub as a tool to share, store and discuss information and ideas related to our projects. As our projects as open source, GitHub is the perfect tool, allowing anyone and everyone to participate. 

To get started, your first task will be to set up a GitHub account. Head on over to the [wiki](https://github.com/kym834/GitHub-How-To-Guide/wiki) and navigate to the 'setting up a GitHub account' page using the table on contents on the right hand side of the screen.
